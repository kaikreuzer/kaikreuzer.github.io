As promised during my talks at the <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2010/">Eclipse Summit Europe</a> and the <a href="http://germany.osgiusers.org/Main/OSGiUFGTreffen2010">OSGi Users' Forum Germany</a>, I have finally fully automated the build of openHAB with Maven3/Tycho and uploaded the result to the openHAB homepage.<br />You will find there a platform-independent runtime zip that should work out of the box on Windows, Linux and Mac. This is all you need to get started. If you prefer IDE support for the configuration and rule files, get the openHAB designer zip file as well.<br />Besides these components, there are also optional bundles available in the download section, which you can add to your runtime if required for your setup. For all of this, simply follow these&nbsp;<a href="https://code.google.com/p/openhab/wiki/Installation">simple installation instructions</a>.<br />Please excuse that the documentation about the configuration files, formats and options is still very limited - please visit the discussion group if you are in any doubt of what you need to do. I'll take care to update the documentation on the website subsequently.
