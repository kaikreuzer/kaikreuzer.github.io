As already mentioned <a href="http://kaikreuzer.blogspot.com/2009/11/reinventing-wheel.html">before</a>, I have started the openHAB project not because nothing on the market could have provided me the desired functionality, but because I want to build something robust, stable and open with a modern technology stack.<br /><br />If I were a pure user, I would still stick with <a href="http://misterhouse.sourceforge.net/">Misterhouse</a> as this has matured over the years so much that they are discussing on their mailing list already whether it's<a href="https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=6.2.5.6.2.20100220225417.01f3fb98%40sinister.net"> better to have a deer head or a magic mirror</a> talking to you.<br /><br />Well, I am not, and so I take the challenge to build something equally useful on top of a JVM. After <a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5335810078566775677&amp;postID=7083932809703448482">Claude's comment</a> I very much considered contributing to the <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/HOME/OpenRemote">openRemote project</a>, tried to dive into the details of their code base and involved myself in technical discussion on their forum. But at the end, I decided against it, because all the main things that I would like to see covered are still on their todo list. That wouldn't be bad at all as it could have given me a good opportunity to contribute the missing things, but unfortunately - at least that is my impression - it would mean more or less a complete rewrite of openRemote...<br />Just to give you a few examples of what openRemote IMHO lacks:<br /><br /><ul><li>No rule engine support yet</li><li>it has a "one-way" protocol, i.e. the client (e.g. iPhone App) is stateless -&gt; it cannot show if lights are on or off, it cannot display values (e.g. temperatures), etc. Version 2.0 will bring a server push, but I am not sure when the client will support this?</li><li>No states are cached on the server which is definitely a problem for rules and stateful clients</li><li>No modularization / extension concept yet, it's one brick (the BOSS)</li><li>No easy protocol to implement for new extensions, see <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/DIY+arduino+home+automation.?focusedCommentId=9601113#comment-9601113">discussion about arduino support</a></li><li>No simple way to build from latest sources, so people are <a href="http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=9601128">desperately waiting</a> for an official build</li></ul><div>I don't say that any of this is bad, I just want to highlight that their architectural approach obviously followed other priorities. I can imagine that openRemote and openHAB can cross-fertilize each other and maybe there is someday a possibility to integrate or even merge these projects - time will tell :-)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
