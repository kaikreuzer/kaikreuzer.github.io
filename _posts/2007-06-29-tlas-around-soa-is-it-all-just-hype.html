One expects of conferences that one is thrown at with all the latest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">TLAs</a>. SOA being one of these for a while already and in the SOA context one also hears about things like ESB, EDA, JBI, SCA, BPEL and so on. Having tried to make any sense of these by reading magazines or listening to podcasts, I truely must admit that attending the TSSJS really helped me to get a clearer picture. E.g. it seems to me that one can forget about JBI - it is one of the technologies being speced and tried out in the real world only afterwards. Sadly however, the spec mainly aims at vendors, while they show no interest (only Sun backs it, while IBM and BEA stop their participation in the JSR). Trying to be yet-another-service-container, this mission is likely to fail and so I come to my personal conclusion that it's not worth the effort to dive into. Another clear sign for me was that none of the attendees of a JBI session was actually using JBI nor considering the use for the future...<br />Instead, SCA seems to have much stronger industry support, also being some kind of service container, but targeted rather towards the application developer than at the platform vendors. Nonetheless it is in its early stages and one will have to see how the adoption rate is going to look like.
