I am going to demonstrate you how easy it is to add new hardware devices to your home automation infrastructure as well - luckily a few sensors are <a href="http://m2mcontest.eclipsecon.org/#general-description">spread out over the conference venue</a>.<br /><br />You have not heard about the <a href="http://m2mcontest.eclipsecon.org/">M2M contest</a> at EclipseCon Europe yet? Go and prepare yourself for your participation then! And no worries - I won't compete with you in the programming contest as I will be a member of the jury :-) Looking forward to your submissions!<br /><br />
