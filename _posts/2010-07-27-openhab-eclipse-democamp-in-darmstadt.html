<p>I had the pleasure to present my <a href="http://www.openhab.org/">openHAB project</a> at the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Helios_2010/Darmstadt">Eclipse Helios DemoCamp in Darmstadt</a> on July 14, 2010. First of all, a big "thank you!" to Jochen Hiller and Marcel Bruch who have organized this great event and gave me the opportunity to do a short demo.</p><p>Altough most of my presentation was a live demo, I also had some slides that I have now <a href="http://slidesharemailer.com/s/pzPAFPATTu-cMbgWoqCsHQ/h1">made available</a> on SlideShare for anyone who is interested.</p><br /><div id="__ss_4843693" style="width: 425px;"><object height="355" id="__sse4843693" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=eclipsedemocamp-openhab-100726133608-phpapp01&stripped_title=openhab-eclipse-democamp-darmstadt" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed name="__sse4843693" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=eclipsedemocamp-openhab-100726133608-phpapp01&stripped_title=openhab-eclipse-democamp-darmstadt" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></div>
