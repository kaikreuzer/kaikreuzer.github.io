It's a long long time since my last post, but I swear that I haven't been lazy or without impulses. Usually, I like to blog while being at conferences and it is not long ago that I attended the last one: The <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2009/">Eclipse Summit Europe 2009</a>. As usual, it was a great event with many interesting people and lively discussions.<br /><br />But a few things detered me from directly blogging about my impressions this time. For example, the ESE2009 organizers did not provide any public Wifi access to the attendees this time. I am not sure whether this was because the Wifi used to be heavily overloaded in the past years or if they just wanted to draw attention to the talks; if latter, this might indeed have worked out as I have seen much fewer people typing on their Macs throughout all sessions... Another reason for not blogging at this occasion was that I was invited to an X-Box soccer competition by the Itemis guys until late at night; these chaps seem to always be prepared for everything ;-) Last but not least, I didn't find much time to blog on the last conference day as I was called to hospital for the birth of my second son - well, I hope that at least this can be accepted as an excuse.<br /><br />Despite all these distractions, I have been working quite eagerly on a new private project that I will very soon blog about; it is quite fascinating and if all goes well, I might present it on a future ESE - let's touch wood!<br /><br />One last remark: As I missed a few sessions at ESE due to my early departure, I am taking the opportunity to join the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2009/Frankfurt">Eclipse Demo Camp in Frankfurt</a> next Thursday. There are already more than 60 people registered for it, which is quite astonishing. So if you are around and don't have any other plans - join me there!
