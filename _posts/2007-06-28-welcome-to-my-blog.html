To be a real geek, I would have had to have a blog already since quite some while - well, come to any conclusion that you prefer, but I am simply happy to now eventually share my thoughts with you online :-)<br />The trigger for me was being currently at <a href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/">The Server Side Java Symposium 2007</a> in Barcelona. It's a really great event and it's a great pleasure to meet all these great people here that one otherwise only know from their blogs, from an article in some magazines or from one of my favourite podcasts. It's really fun being a part of the community and therefore it becomes a real necessity to have a blog myself as well.<br />So please enjoy it, visit it regularly and leave your comments!
