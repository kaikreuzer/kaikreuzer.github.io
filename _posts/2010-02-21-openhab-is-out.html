It took quite some preparation, but finally I can anounce that I have created the envisioned Open Source project for my (and others!) home automation needs!<br /><br />In order to avoid any brandmark violations, I have reconsidered the name of the project, so that it is now called the <span style="font-size: small;"><b style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">open Home Automation Bus (openHAB)</b></span>.<br /><br />You will find the project hosted at Google Code at <a href="http://openhab.org/">http://openhab.org</a>, even an initial codebase is already available. Although it's not doing much at all yet, it should give interested persons an idea of its architecture and show that things are moving and the project is on its way.<br /><br />I will soon post further background information about the decisions taken, so stay tuned :-)
