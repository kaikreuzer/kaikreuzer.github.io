When initiating an Open Source project like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openhab/">openHAB</a>, one of the many questions you have to answer before you start is: <i>What VCS should I use?</i><br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal;">In the beginning I did not really realize that this is an important question. Being a professional Java developer building commercial products with Eclipse, the use of Subversion with Subversive as an IDE integration just seemed natural to me and not worth any further considerations.</span></i><br /><br />It was more by chance that I noticed <a href="http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=9601100">questions about using git</a> on other OS projects that were using SVN as well as the activities in the Eclipse community around <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/egit/">(E)git</a>. When Ekkehard Gentz started <a href="http://ekkescorner.wordpress.com/blog-series/git-mercurial/">a blog series about DVCS</a>&nbsp;and Eclipse, I eventually decided that I needed to have a closer look.<br /><br />After having grasped the great advantages of a DVCS, especially for Open Source projects, I then had to decide for one - to keep things simply, I only looked at the most popular ones, Git and Mercurial.<br /><br />As I am using OSGi and Eclipse, there were quite some strong arguments for Git:<br /><ul><li>With JGit there is a pure Java implementation available</li><li>EGit is now under the Eclipse umbrella and actively developed by many gifted Eclipse committers.</li><li>It seems that Git is more hyped than Mercurial (at least that's my personal impression).</li><li>Git seems to be more powerful and flexible</li></ul><div>Hence I installed Git and EGit and gave it a try. After working with it a bit, I noticed that I didn't really feel comfortable with it. It is difficult to say why, but I made out the following reasons:</div><div><ul><li>&nbsp;I am a Mac and Windows user and Git somehow made me feel that its home is Linux. Although there is now a Windows version with&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysgit</a>, cygwin used to be the official way of using Git on Windows.</span></li><li>Coming from SVN, the Git vocabulary can be confusing - e.g. something like a svn revert is not done with <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-revert.html">git-revert</a>, but with <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reset.html">git-reset</a>. Together with the abundance of commands and functionality of Git, this can easily make people feel lost if it's their first time with a distributed VCS.</li><li>The standard way for pushing and polling with Git is ssh - but this makes things much more difficult to use, if you are <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/github/browse_thread/thread/de6c27b1a2014b27/c4299f941032d17a?pli=1">behind a firewall</a>.</li><li>EGit is still an incubation project and there's still some way to go until it reaches a level like Subversive: There is no support for the "Team Synchronization" view, which I use a lot. It also had some trouble with deletion and renaming of files. Last but not least - it is lacking icons on the context menus. Ha, I know,&nbsp;this is only cosmetics and should not be relevant at all; but still it leaves the impression of being a version to early to be used.</li></ul><div>Almost all of the above items felt better on Mercurial (and HgEclipse), so I finally decided to go for it. I guess on the long run, I might reconsider this, once EGit has matured, but for the time being I am happy with this situation. And it is very reassuring that there are plenty of tools around to convert a Mercurial repo into a Git repo and vice versa - so no decision needs to be taken for eternity!</div><div><br /></div><div>Now I am only waiting for Ekke to finish his series to eventually see to what conclusion he came and which DVCS is the one of his choice :-)</div></div><div><br /></div>
