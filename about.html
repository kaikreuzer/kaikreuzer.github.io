<p>I am a professional software architect and developer evangelist, working in the Consumer IoT department of <a href="https://www.telekom.de">Deutsche Telekom</a> in my day job. I am an expert in building and leading Open Source developer communities.</p>

<p>Home automation is my passion since childhood and in 2010, I have founded the very popular <a href="http://www.openhab.org">open Home Automation Bus (openHAB)</a> project and am the project lead of the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/smarthome">Eclipse SmartHome</a> project, which is part of the IoT efforts of the Eclipse Foundation.</p>

<p>You can meet me at international conferences, where I regularly speak about all topics around smart homes.</p>
