<p>I am a professional Java developer and software architect, working in the Connected Home department of <a href="https://www.telekom.de">Deutsche Telekom</a> in my day job.</p>
Home automation is my passion since childhood and has become my most time-consuming hobby since then.</p>

<p>In 2010, I have founded the very popular <a href="http://www.openhab.org">open Home Automation Bus (openHAB)</a> project and am the project lead of the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/smarthome">Eclipse SmartHome</a> project, which is part of the IoT efforts of the Eclipse Foundation.</p>

<p>You can meet me at international conferences, where I regularly speak about all topics around smart homes.</p>
